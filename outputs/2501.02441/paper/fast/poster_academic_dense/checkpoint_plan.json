        "content": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on massive datasets. However, this has led to significant concerns regarding data misappropriation, where proprietary or copyrighted data is used for training without consent. Existing detection methods, such as membership inference attacks (MIA) and dataset lineage tracing, often lack a rigorous statistical foundation, leading to high false-positive rates or insufficient power. Current limitations include: 1) The 'black-box' nature of LLMs makes it difficult to verify training sets. 2) Traditional metrics like perplexity are sensitive to distribution shifts and prompt engineering. 3) There is a lack of a formal hypothesis testing framework that can provide provable guarantees on the Type-I error (false discovery) while maintaining high power in detecting data leakage across diverse text domains.",

        "title": "Methodology: Statistical Hypothesis Testing Framework",
        "type": "content",
        "content": "The proposed framework formulates data misappropriation detection as a formal hypothesis test. Let \\( D_{test} \\) be the suspicious dataset and \\( \\mathcal{M} \\) be the target LLM. The null hypothesis \\( H_0 \\) posits that \\( D_{test} \\) was not used in training \\( \\mathcal{M} \\), while the alternative \\( H_1 \\) suggests it was. The framework utilizes a log-likelihood based statistic: \\( S = \frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log P_{\\mathcal{M}}(x_i | x_{<i}) \\), where \\( x_i \\) are tokens in the test set. To account for the inherent complexity of different text samples, the method employs a 'Reference Model' \\( \\mathcal{M}_{ref} \\) to normalize the scores. The test statistic is defined as: \\( T = \frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\log \frac{P_{\\mathcal{M}}(x_i)}{P_{\\mathcal{M}_{ref}}(x_i)} \\). If \\( T \\) exceeds a threshold determined by the distribution under \\( H_0 \\), the null hypothesis is rejected. The framework includes a calibration step using a proxy non-member dataset to estimate the null distribution's variance and mean, ensuring the p-values are uniformly distributed under \\( H_0 \\). This allows for controlling the False Positive Rate (FPR) at a pre-specified level \\( \\alpha \\).",

        "content": "The framework was evaluated using multiple LLMs, including LLaMA-7B, OPT-6.7B, and GPT-2, across various datasets like Wikitext-103, Enron Emails, and CodeSearchNet. The experiments focused on the Power of the test (True Positive Rate) at a fixed Type-I error rate (FPR = 0.05). For LLaMA-7B, the framework achieved a detection power of 0.94 on Wikitext and 0.88 on specialized code datasets, significantly outperforming baseline MIA methods which hovered around 0.65-0.72. Sensitivity analysis showed that even with partial misappropriation (where only 10% of the proprietary data is used), the framework maintains a power above 0.75. Ablation studies on the reference model selection indicated that using a model from the same family but smaller scale (e.g., LLaMA-1.3B as a reference for LLaMA-7B) provides the most stable calibration. The results also demonstrate robustness against common obfuscation techniques like synonym substitution and paraphrasing, where the detection power remained above 0.82.",

        "content": "The paper provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for detecting data misappropriation in LLMs. Key contributions include: 1) The introduction of a formal statistical hypothesis testing framework that allows for controlled Type-I error rates. 2) The development of a reference-normalized test statistic that effectively mitigates the impact of text intrinsic difficulty. 3) Extensive empirical validation showing that the method is highly effective even under low-data regimes and adversarial settings. 4) The framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to any LLM with likelihood access, providing a practical tool for IP protection in the AI era. The findings suggest that statistical signatures of training data remain detectable even after extensive fine-tuning or alignment processes.",
